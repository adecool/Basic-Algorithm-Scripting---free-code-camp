# Basic-Algorithm-Scripting---free-code-camp
In This set of basic javascript challenge: it was fun having to apply the things i have learnt.
some were tough, but i scaled through.

## MY SOLVED CHALLENGES:
1. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
2. Reverse A String
3. Factorialize a number
4. Find the longest word in a string
5. Return largest number in a array
6. Confirm the ending
  * Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argum).
7. Repeat a String.
8. Truncate a String.
9. Finders Keepers.
  * I Created a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'truth test'.
  ** This means that given an element x, the 'truth test' is passed if func(x) is true. If no element passes the test, return undefined.
10. Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive. Return true or false.
11. Title Case A Sentence.
12. Slice and Splice
  > in this code i created a function that solved
  ** Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.Return the resulting array.
13. Falsy Bouncer 
   In this challenge i built a function that remove falsy values from an array and return a new array without falsy values.
14. Where do i belong:
          * I built a function that do the following:
          Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted.
          The returned value should be a number.
15. Mutations
16. Chunky Monkey.

I am so eager to take up the intermediate algorithm scripting.
